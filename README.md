## A Heartfelt Farewell to Virat

> Dear Virat,  
>   
> It’s hard to put into words what you’ve meant to me and an entire generation of cricket fans — and even harder to accept that an era has come to an end. Your retirement from Test cricket feels like the end of something deeply personal, something I’ve grown up with.  
>   
> You weren’t just a player — you were an emotion. A heartbeat. A relentless force of passion, grit, and belief. Whether it was those fierce cover drives, the pumped-up roars, or the way you carried the weight of expectations on your shoulders — you made us believe that nothing was impossible if done with fire in the heart.  
>   
> Test cricket felt different when you were at the crease — charged, alive, meaningful. You made whites feel heroic again.  
>   
> Thank you for the memories. For the centuries in tough conditions. For the fierce rivalries. For being a captain who wore his heart on his sleeve. For redefining fitness. For never backing down. For showing what it means to fight for the badge.  
>   
> This tribute is a small gesture from a big admirer.  
>   
> You may have left the longest format, but your impact will echo through every red ball that bounces on a Test pitch.  
>   
> With deep respect,  
> Deepak
