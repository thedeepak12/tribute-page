                At Centurion in 2018, Kohli played one of his grittiest knocks under difficult overseas conditions.

                On a spicy pitch with variable bounce and against a quality South African pace attack led by Morne Morkel, Kagiso Rabada and Vernon Philander, Kohli compiled a superb 153 out of India’s total of 307.
